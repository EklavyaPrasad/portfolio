              "Developed a real-time messaging app using Flutter for the UI and
              Firebase for the cloud backend. Designed and implemented group
              chat functionality, allowing users to engage in conversations with
              profanity filtering in place. Leveraged Flutter's UI toolkit to
              create a visually appealing user interface, while utilizing
              Firebase's real-time database to ensure instant synchronization of
              chat messages. Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills by
              implementing automated profanity filtering to maintain a positive
              user experience. Collaborated with a team to conduct testing,
              resulting in a robust and efficient application. This project
              showcased proficiency in Flutter, Firebase, and delivering
              user-centric solutions."

            <h3>Live Emotion Detection</h3>

            <p>
              Live Emotion Detection app is a mobile application that is
              developed using the dart and flutter frameworks, and it can be
              deployed on Android and iOS, as well as a number of platforms
              including web, Windows, and Linux. The motive of this mobile
              application is to identify emotion of an individual in real time.
              As the data needed for labeling the emotions was integrated into
              the app itself, the app doesn’t need internet for the processing.
              The app also holds a user-friendly UI for easy navigation and
              hence improving the user experience. A TFLite model has been built
              using Google Teachable Machine and it runs real-time filtering on
              the camera live feed or the image that has been selected by the
              user and tags them with the most appropriate emotion label based
              on the data

            <p>April 2022</p>
            <p>
              As a dedicated and skilled developer, I designed and developed the
              back-end and front-end components for the User Credentials page,
              enabling seamless updating and management of user data. I
              implemented an OTP-based user authentication system, significantly
              reducing unauthorized access instances. By implementing the
              Sidebar Navigation Menu and the Chat Screen, I enhanced the
              application's design, making substantial improvements to the User
              Interface and enhancing system usability. My expertise in
              debugging and issue resolution allowed me to identify and fix
              existing system problems, resulting in an improved user experience
              and increased satisfaction.

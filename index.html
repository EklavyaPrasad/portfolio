              <h3>Flash Chat</h3>
              <p>
                "I developed a real-time messaging app using Flutter for the UI
                and Firebase for the cloud backend. The app featured group chat
                functionality with profanity filtering. I utilized Flutter's UI
                toolkit to create an appealing user interface and Firebase's
                real-time database for instant message synchronization.
                Implementing automated profanity filtering demonstrated strong
                problem-solving skills. I collaborated with a team for testing,
                resulting in a robust application. This project showcased
                proficiency in Flutter, Firebase, and delivering user-centric
                solutions."

              <h3>Live Emotion Detection</h3>
              <p>
                The Live Emotion Detection app is a mobile application developed
                using Dart and Flutter frameworks. It can be deployed on various
                platforms, including Android, iOS, web, Windows, and Linux. The
                app accurately identifies real-time emotions of individuals
                without requiring internet connectivity. It integrates a
                user-friendly UI for seamless navigation, enhancing the overall
                user experience. The TFLite model, created with Google Teachable
                Machine, performs live filtering on camera feed or selected
                images, assigning the most suitable emotion label based on
                integrated data.
